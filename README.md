# 👨‍💻 **Side Code – A Real-Time Code Testing Chrome Extension**  

While learning to code and watching YouTube tutorials, I often found myself switching between the video and my code editor. This disrupted my flow, so I built **Side Code** – a **Chrome extension** that lets you write and test JavaScript, Phyton, PHP, Java, C++, C#, and Bash in real time, directly from a side panel! 🚀
